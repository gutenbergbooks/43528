<h2><a name="THE_ROCK_OF_CASHEL" id="THE_ROCK_OF_CASHEL">THE ROCK OF CASHEL, AS SEEN FROM THE SOUTH.</a></h2>

<p>To such of our readers as have not had the good fortune to
see the ancient metropolis of Munster, our prefixed illustration
will, it is hoped, give some general idea of the situation
and grandeur of a group of ruins, which on various accounts
claim to rank as the most interesting in the British islands.
Ancient buildings of greater extent and higher architectural
splendour may indeed be found elsewhere; but in no other
spot in the empire can there be seen congregated together so
many structures of such different characters and uses, and of
such separate and remote ages; their imposing effect being
strikingly heightened by the singularity and grandeur of their
situation, and the absence from about them of any objects
that might destroy the associations they are so well calculated
to excite. To give an adequate idea, however, of this magnificent
architectural assemblage, would require not one, but a
series of views, from its various surrounding sides. These we
shall probably furnish in the course of our future numbers;
and in the mean time we may state, that the buildings of
which it is composed are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st, An Ecclesiastical Round Tower, in perfect preservation.</p>

<p>2d, Cormac&#8217;s Chapel, a small stone-roofed church, with
two side-towers, in the Norman style of the eleventh and
twelfth centuries&mdash;also in good preservation.</p>

<p>3d, A Cathedral, with nave, choir, and transepts, in the
pointed style of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, now in
ruins, but which was originally only second in extent and the
magnificence of its architecture to the cathedrals in our own
metropolis.</p>

<p>4th, A strong Castle, which served as the palace of the
Archbishops of Cashel.</p>

<p>5th, The Vicar&#8217;s Hall, and the mansions of the inferior ecclesiastical
officers of the Cathedral, which are also in ruins.</p>

<p>If, then, the reader will picture to himself such a group of
buildings, standing in solitary grandeur on a lofty, isolated,
and on some sides precipitous rock, in the midst of the green
luxuriant plains of &#8220;the Golden Vale,&#8221; he may be able to form
some idea of the various aspects of sublimity and picturesqueness
which it is so well calculated to assume, and of the exciting
interest it must necessarily create even in minds of the
lowest degree of intellectuality. Viewed from any point, it is,
indeed, such a scene as, once beheld, would impress itself on the
memory for ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p><p>It would appear from our ancient histories that the Rock
of Cashel was the site of the regal fortress of the Kings of
Munster, from ages anterior to the preaching of the gospel
in Ireland; and it is stated in the ancient lives of our patron
Saint, that the monarch Ængus, the son of Nathfraoich, was
here converted, with his family, and the nobles of Munster, by
St Patrick in the fifth century. It would appear also from the
same authorities, that at this period there was a Pagan temple
within the fortress, which the Irish apostle destroyed; and
though it is nowhere distinctly stated, as far as we are able to
discover, that a Christian church was founded on its site in
that age, the fact that it was so, may fairly be inferred from
the statement in the Tripartite Life of the Saint, in which it
is stated that no less than seventeen kings, descended from
Ængus and his brother Oilioll, being ordained monks, reigned
at Cashel, from the time of St Patrick to the reign of Cinngeoghan,
who, according to the Annals of Innisfallen, was
deposed in the year 901, Cormac MacCuilleanan being set up
in his place. However this may be, it can hardly admit of
doubt that a church was erected, if not at that time, at least
some centuries afterwards, as appears from the existing
round tower, which is unquestionably of an age considerably
anterior to any of the other structures now remaining. It is
said, indeed, and popularly believed, that a cathedral church
was erected here in the ninth century by the King-Bishop
Cormac MacCuilleanan; and if we had historical authority
for this supposition, we might conclude, with every probability,
that the round tower was of that age. But no such
evidence has been found, and Cashel is only noticed in our annals
as a regal residence of the Munster kings, till the beginning
of the twelfth century, when, at the year 1101, it is stated
in the Annals of the Four Masters, that &#8220;a convocation of the
people of Leoth Mogha, or the southern half of Ireland, was
held at Cashel, at which Murtough O&#8217;Brien, with the nobles
of the laity and clergy, and O&#8217;Dunan, the illustrious bishop
and chief senior of Ireland, attended, and on which occasion
Murtough O&#8217;Brien made such an offering as king never made
before him, namely, Cashel of the Kings, which he bestowed
on the devout, without the intervention of a laic or an ecclesiastic,
but for the use of the religious of Ireland in general.&#8221;
The successor of this monarch, Cormac MacCarthy, being deposed
in 1127, as stated in the Annals of Innisfallen, commenced
the erection of the church, now popularly called
&#8220;Cormac&#8217;s Chapel.&#8221; He was, however, soon afterwards restored
to his throne, and on the completion of this church it
was consecrated in 1134. This event is recorded by all our
ancient annalists in nearly the following words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;1134. The church built by Cormac MacCarthy at Cashel
was consecrated this year by the archbishop and bishops of
Munster, at which ceremony the nobility of Ireland, both
clergy and laity, were present.&#8221;</p>

<p>It can scarcely be doubted that this was the finest architectural
work hitherto erected in Ireland, but its proportions
were small; and when, in 1152, the archbishopric of Munster
was fixed at Cashel by Cardinal John Paparo, the papal legate,
it became necessary to provide a church of greater amplitude.
The present cathedral was in consequence erected
by Donald O&#8217;Brien, King of Limerick, and endowed with ample
provisions in lands, and the older church was converted
into a chapel, or chapter-house.</p>

<p>But though the present ruined cathedral claims this very early
antiquity, its existing architectural features chiefly belong to a
later age&mdash;namely, the commencement of the fifteenth century,
when, as appears from Wares&#8217;s Antiquities, the cathedral
was rebuilt by the archbishop, Richard O&#8217;Hedian, or at
least repaired, from a very ruinous condition in which it then
was. The Vicar&#8217;s Hall, &amp;c. was also erected by this prelate;
and it is not improbable that the castle was erected, or at least
re-edified, at the same period. It would appear, however, to
have been repaired as late as the sixteenth century, from the
shields bearing the arms of Fitzgerald and Butler, which are
sculptured on it&mdash;prelates of these names having governed
the see in succession in the early half of that century.</p>

<p>The interior of the cathedral is crowded with monuments
of considerable antiquity; and the tomb of Cormac MacCarthy
is to be seen on one side of the north porch, at the entrance
to his chapel. It was opened above a century since, and a
pastoral staff, of exquisite beauty, and corresponding in style
with the ornaments of the chapel, was extracted from it. It
is now in the possession of Mr Petrie. The cemetery contains
no monument of any considerable age; but on the south
side there is a splendid but greatly dilapidated stone cross,
which, there can be no doubt, belongs to the twelfth century.</p>

<p>To give any detailed description of the architectural features
of these various edifices, would extend beyond the space
prescribed by the limits of our little Journal for a single paper;
yet, as some description will be expected of us, we shall briefly
state a few particulars.</p>

<p>The round tower&mdash;the more ancient remain upon the
Rock&mdash;is fifty-six feet in circumference and ninety feet in
height; it contains five stories, has four apertures at top, and
has its doorway twelve feet from the ground.</p>

<p>Cormac&#8217;s Chapel consists of a nave and choir, but has neither
transepts nor lateral aisles. It is richly decorated in the Norman
style of the time, both exteriorly and interiorly; and the entire
length of the building is fifty-three feet. There are crypts
between the arches of the choir and nave and the stone roof;
and there is a square tower on each side of the building, at the
junction of the nave and choir. Taken as a whole, there is no
specimen of its kind in the British empire so perfect or curious.</p>

<p>The cathedral, as already stated, consists of a choir, nave,
and transepts, with a square tower in the centre. The
greatest length, from east to west, is about two hundred and
ten feet, and the breadth in the transepts is about a hundred
and seventy feet. There are no side aisles, and the windows
are of the lancet form, usual in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries. A century has not yet elapsed since this magnificent
pile was doomed to destruction, and that by one who
should have been its most zealous preserver. Archbishop
Price, who succeeded to this see in 1744, and died in 1752,
not being able, as tradition states, to drive in his carriage up
the steep ascent to the church door, procured an act of parliament
to remove the cathedral from the Rock of Cashel into
the town, on which the roof was taken off for the value of the
lead, and the venerable pile was abandoned to ruin!</p>

<p>Of the remarkable historical events connected with these
ruins, our space will only permit us to state, that in 1495
the cathedral was burned by Gerald, the eighth Earl of Kildare;
for which act, being accused before the king, his excuse
was, that it was true, but that he would not have done so but
that he had supposed the archbishop was in it; and his candour
was rewarded with the chief governorship of Ireland!</p>

<p>In 1647, the cathedral&mdash;being filled with a vast number of
persons, many of whom were ecclesiastics, who had fled thither
for refuge and protection, a strong garrison having been placed
in it by Lord Taafe&mdash;was taken by storm by the Lord Inchiquin,
with a considerable slaughter of the garrison and citizens,
including twenty ecclesiastics. It was again taken by
Cromwell in the year 1649.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we shall only remark, that the venerable
group of ruins of which we have attempted this slight sketch,
considered as an object of interest to pleasure tourists, and
those of our own country in particular, have not as yet been
sufficiently appreciated; and that, as Sir Walter Scott truly
remarked, though the scenery of our lakes and mountains may
be rivalled in many parts of the sister islands, there is nothing
of their class, viewed as a whole, comparable in interest
with the ruins on the Rock of Cashel.</p>

<p>&mdash;To our illustrious countryman. Bishop Berkeley, may be with justice
applied what he himself says of his favourite, Plato, that
&#8220;he has joined with an imagination the most splendid and
magnificent, an intellect fully as deep and clear.&#8221; A morsel
of poetry from such a writer ought to be preserved as a literary
curiosity, and as a proof of the great variety of his talents;
but when we consider that the following was written
almost in a prophetic spirit, more than a century ago, and
consequently long before the events to which he seems to allude
could well have been anticipated, it has an additional
claim upon our notice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Know thyself,&#8221; was the wise advice of the ancient Greek
philosopher; and it is certainly desirable that we should know
ourselves, and take every pains in our power to acquire self-knowledge.
But the task is by no means an easy one; and
hence the poet Burns well exclaims,</p>

<p>Determined, however, as we for own part always are, to acquire
a knowledge of ourselves, we felt no small gratification
at the opportunity which, we presumed, would be amply
afforded us by the work of Messrs Bartlett and Willis, the
first an English artist, and the second an American <i>litterateur</i>,
who have left their homes, in a most commendable spirit of
philanthropy, to depict our scenery and antiquities, and to tell
us all that it behoves us to know about them and ourselves.
We accordingly lost not a moment in possessing ourselves of
the precious treasure that would, as we hoped, &#8220;the giftie
gi&#8217;e us, to see oursells as others see us;&#8221; and verily we must acknowledge
that our wonderment during its perusal has been
excessive, and that it has convinced us that we never knew
ourselves before, or ever saw any thing about us with proper
eyes. Henceforward we shall be cautious how we trust to the
evidence of our senses for any thing we may see, for it is
pretty plain that hitherto they have been of no manner of use
to us. They have deceived and bamboozled us our whole lives
long; and from the present moment we will trust to none save
those of Messrs Bartlett and Willis&mdash;at least we will never
trust to our own.</p>

<p>The very vignette on the title-page gave us some startling
notification of the fearful discovery that awaited us. We had
flattered ourselves that we were quite familiar with all the
remarkable features of Irish scenery, and should not fail at a
glance to identify any delineation of them, inasmuch as there
is not a river or lake in Ireland of any extent that we have
not sailed on, not a mountain that we have not climbed, not a
headland or island on our coast that we have not visited. But
here was a subject of a striking and most remarkable character
that appeared quite new to us, nor should we ever have
been able to guess at it, if a friend to whom we applied for information
had not assured us, to our utter astonishment, that
he was informed it was nothing less than our old acquaintance
the Giants&#8217; Causeway! The wonder at our blindness, however,
in some degree diminished when we perceived&mdash;if we can guess
at the only point from which such a view could be obtained&mdash;that
the ingenious artist had represented the sun setting in the
north; for as often as we had been at the Causeway, we never
had the observation or good fortune to witness such a sight.
We must confess, moreover, that our feelings of mortification
at our ignorance were partly soothed, when we turned over to
the next vignette, which we at once recognised by its bridge
to have been intended for Poul-a-phuca, or, as Messrs Bartlett
and Willis name it, more correctly we presume, Phoula
Phuca! We cannot, however, state the impression left on our
minds by each of the prints in succession; but we shall take a
glance at two or three of them; and when we have pointed
out the particulars that most confounded us in each, we can
have little doubt that such of our readers as have never seen
the places they are intended to represent, will concur in the
conviction that has been forced upon us by our inspection of
them.</p>

<p>The first of them that astounded us beyond measure was
that called &#8220;Ancient Cross, Clonmacnoise.&#8221; At this place
we had erewhile spent some of our happiest hours, meditating
among its tombs, and admiring alike its various ancient
architectural remains, and the sublimely desolate but appropriate
character of its natural scenery. So familiar had we
grown with this most exciting scene, that we thought that
we should have been able to identify every stone in it blindfold;
but that was all a mistake: we had only a dim and
erroneous vision of its features; we saw nothing accurately.
For instance, the stone cross which forms the principal object
in the foreground, and which gives name to this subject&mdash;this
cross, which we had often drawn and measured,
and found to be just fifteen feet in height, as Harris the
antiquary had supposed before us, here appears to be more
than twenty feet! while the base of it, which to our eyes
always presented the appearance of a surface covered with
a sculptural design of a deer-hunt, by men, dogs, chariots,
and horses, is here an unadorned blank! The small round
tower in the middle ground, which, as we believed, stood
on the very shore, nearly level with the Shannon, has in
this view mounted up the side of the hill. But what struck
us as furnishing the most remarkable proofs of our defect
of vision is, that the doorway of the great round tower,
called O&#8217;Rourke&#8217;s Tower, which, according to our measurement,
was five feet six inches in height, and placed at
the distance of eight feet from the ground, is here represented
as at least twenty feet from it; and the stone wall of the
cemetery, which, as it seemed to our perception, ran nearly
from the doorway of the tower to within a few yards of the
cross, has no existence whatever in the print, its place being
occupied by some huge Druidical monument which we never
were able to see. The perspective in this view is also of a
novel kind, and well worthy of the attention of the Irish
artists, and all those in Ireland who may hitherto have supposed
that they knew something of this science. They will
see that the level lines, or courses, on circular buildings, instead
of ascending to the horizontal line when below it, descend
to some horizontal line of their own; and that in fact
there is not one horizontal line only in the picture, but perhaps
a dozen, which fully proves that our previous notions on
this point were wholly erroneous.</p>

<p>But we must hurry on. What have we got next? &#8220;Clew
Bay from West Port,&#8221; or &#8220;Baie De Clew, vue de West
Port.&#8221; Well, we believe this is intended for the beautiful Bay
of Westport, called Clew Bay; but, if so, what has become
of the beautiful country of Murisk, renowned in Irish song,
which used to be situated at the base of Croagh Phadraig, or
Croagh Patric? And is this the noble Reek itself? Good
heavens! but it must have suffered from some strange convulsion
since we saw it; it has been actually torn into a perpendicular
cliff from its very summit to its base. But what
are we thinking of? It was, we suppose, always so; and our
not having observed it, is only a proof that we were never
able to look at it correctly&mdash;and we should know better in
future.</p>

<p>One peep more, and we shall have done. What is this?
Scene from Cloonacartin Hill, Connemara. Ay, that&#8217;s a scene
we have looked at for many an hour. That group of jagged
and pointed mountains to the left is the glorious Twelve Pins
of Binnabeola. We never indeed saw them grouped so closely
together, or standing so upright; but no matter: the hurricane
of last year perhaps has blown them together, and carried
away their sloping bases. But what do we see in the middle
ground? The two lakes of Derry Clare and Lough Ina joined
in one; and the rapid and unnavigable river which united
them, or which we thought we saw there&mdash;where is it? <i>Non
est incentus</i>: alas! alas! it is not to be found. Most wonderful!
Lough Ina, with its three little wooded islands, no longer
exists as a separate lake. It has, however, now got ten islands
instead of three; but, then, they are all bare&mdash;all, all!&mdash;and
the ancient ones have lost their wood. In like manner the flat
heathy grounds between the mountains and the lakes to the
right, have wholly disappeared, and nothing but water is to be
seen in their place.</p>

<p>But our limits will not permit us to notice any more of Mr
Bartlett&#8217;s innumerable discoveries, which are equally remarkable
in all his other views; so, after making him our grateful
bow, we turn to the labours of his coadjutor, the celebrated
author of &#8220;Pencillings by the Way,&#8221; little doubting
that by his lucubrations we shall be equally edified and
astonished. Mr Willis does not attempt a description of
the scenes depicted by his co-labourer&mdash;it would, perhaps, be
a difficult task for him, as in the instance of the view from
Cloonacartin Hill, which we have noticed. But instead
thereof, he treats us to pencillings of his own of a very
graphic character, and usually as little like nature, as we
had supposed it in Ireland, as even the drawings of Mr
Bartlett. The chief difference between them is, that while
the sketches of the one are landscape, those of the other are
generally in the figure line; and after the model of the Dutch
masters, mostly consisting of hackney-car drivers, waiters,
chambermaids, and, what his principal forte lies in, beggars!
In his sketches of the latter he beats Callot himself; they are
evidently drawn for love of the thing. After witnessing &#8220;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
splendid failure at Eglintoun Castle,&#8221; Mr Willis embarks at
Port-Patrick, and lands at Donaghadee. This he tells us he did
in imitation of St Patrick, &#8220;who evidently,&#8221; like Mr Willis,
&#8220;knew enough of geography to decide which point of Scotland
was nearest to the opposite shore.&#8221; This was new to
us; but it should be noted in chronicles. He then travels
on an Irish car to Belfast, and, like more of our modern
visitors who favour us with their lucubrations, gives us a
sketch of the said car, horse, and its driver, which, of
course, are all singular things in their way. The pencilling,
however, is a pleasant one enough, as it shows us that the car-driver
very soon smoked the character of the travellers he had
to take care of, and quizzed accordingly in a very proper and
creditable Irish style. After a dangerous journey Mr Willis
arrives safely in Belfast, and proceeds to give us his sketch
of its inhabitants in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was market-day at Belfast, and the streets were
thronged with the country people, the most inactive crowd
of human beings, it struck me, that I had ever seen. The
women were all crouching under their grey cloaks, or squatting
upon the thills of the potato-carts, or upon steps or curb-stones;
and the men were leaning where there was any thing
to lean against, or dragging their feet heavily after them, in
a listless lounge along the pavement. It was difficult to remember
that this was the most energetic and mercurial population
in the world; yet a second thought tells one that
there is an analogy in this to the habits of the most powerful
of the animal creation&mdash;the lion and the leopard, when not
excited, taking their ease like the Irishman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Men of Belfast, what think you of that? But hear him
out&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had thought, among a people so imaginative as the Irish,
to have seen some touch of fancy in dress, if ever so poor&mdash;a
bit of ribbon on the women&#8217;s caps, or a jaunty cock of the
&#8216;boy&#8217;s&#8217; tile, or his jacket or coat worn shapely and with an
air. But dirty cloaks, ribbonless caps, uncombed hair, and
not even a little straw taken from the cart and put under
them when they sat on the dirty side-walk, were universal
symptoms that left no room for belief in the existence of any
vanity whatsoever in the women; many of them of an age,
too, when such fancies are supposed to be universal to the sex.
The men could scarce be less ornamental in their exteriors;
but the dirty sugar-loaf hat, with a shapeless rim, and a twine
around it to hold a pipe; the coat thrown over the shoulders,
with the sleeves hanging behind; the shoes mended by a wisp
of straw stuffed into the holes, and their faces and bare breasts
nearly as dirty as their feet, were alike the uniform of old and
young. Still those who were not bargaining were laughing,
and even in our flourishing canter through the market I had
time to make up my mind, that if they had taken a farewell of
vanity, they had not of fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again we say, men of Belfast, what think you of that?
Did you ever see yourselves in this manner? If so, we must
say that it is more than we ever did, though we have spent
many a gay week in your noble, thriving, and most industrious
town. &#8220;Neither a bit of ribbon on the women&#8217;s caps,
nor a jaunty cock of the boy&#8217;s tile;&#8221; no, &#8220;but the dirty sugar-loaf
hat, with a shapeless rim, and a twine round it to hold a
pipe; and the shoes mended by a wisp of straw stuffed into the
holes,&#8221; &amp;c. This certainly flogs; and we must look more attentively
to the Belfastians in future.</p>

<p>Mr Willis proceeds to the hotel called the Donegal Arms,
which he allows is a handsome house, in a broad and handsome
street; and then he adds, &#8220;But I could not help pointing out
to my companion the line of soiled polish at the height of a
man&#8217;s shoulder on every wall and doorpost within sight, showing,
with the plainness of a high-water mark, the average
height as well as the prevailing habit of the people. We certainly
have not yet found time to acquire <i>that</i> polish in America
[most civilized people!]; and if we must wait till the working
classes find time to lean, it will be a century or two at
least before we can show as polished an hotel as the Donegal
Arms at Belfast, or (at that particular line above the side
walk) as polished a city altogether.&#8221; Such is Mr Willis&#8217;s
description of the Gresham&#8217;s Hotel of Belfast, a house which
we had foolishly thought was remarkable for its cleanliness,
order, and good accommodation. Of course he got a miserable
dinner of &#8220;unornamented chops and potatoes,&#8221; after which
he proceeded to visit the lions of Belfast. But we cannot
follow him in all his wanderings, though he tells us many
things that are not a little amusing, as, for instance, that the
houses have a <i>noseless</i> and flattened aspect; that he saw Dubufe&#8217;s
pictures of Adam and Eve, and sagaciously remarks
how curious it is to observe how particularly clean they are
(that is, Adam and Eve) before they sinned, and how very
dingy after&mdash;being dirtied by their fall; and, what was very
agreeable to him, the exhibitor of the pictures actually called
him by name, having remembered seeing the great penciller
in America! After having read the advertisements stuck on
every wall, of &#8220;vessels bound to New York,&#8221; and having
&#8220;<i>done</i> that end of the town,&#8221; he returned towards the inn.
He then sallied out again to <i>do</i> the other end, and tells us with
great satisfaction of a successful petty larceny of a very sentimental
kind which he achieved in the Botanical Gardens&mdash;namely,
plucking a <i>heart&#8217;s-ease</i>, as an expressive remembrance
of his visit&mdash;&#8220;in spite of a cautionary placard, and the keeper
standing under the porch and looking on.&#8221; After this feat he
returned to the inn, and very wisely went to bed. &#8220;A bare-footed
damsel, with very pink heels&#8221;&mdash;recollect, reader, that
this was in the Donegal Arms&mdash;&#8220;was</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">&#8216;My grim chamberlain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who lighted me to bed:&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>and in some fear of oversleeping the hour for the coach in the
morning, I reiterated, and &#8216;sealed with a silver token,&#8217; my
request to be waked at six. Fortunately for a person who
possesses Sancho&#8217;s &#8216;alacrity at sleep,&#8217; the noise of a coach
rattling over the pavement woke me just in time to save my
coffee and my place. I returned to my chamber the moment
before mounting the coach for something I had forgotten,
and as the clock was striking <i>eight</i>, the faithful damsel
knocked at my door and informed me that it was <i>past six</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr Willis is a fortunate traveller. Often as we have stopped
at the Donegal Arms, we never had the good fortune to see
the pink heels or bare legs of a chambermaid; and the moral
economy of the house must be greatly changed also, when
they allow the gentlemen to be called by the said bare-legged
damsels; a duty which, in our visits at it and all other respectable
hotels, always devolved on that useful personage called
Boots. We do not think, however, that this change of the system&mdash;leaving
the calling of the gentlemen to the chambermaids&mdash;would
work well, except in the case of American travellers.
Still, however, as he says, he was in time, and started off&mdash;no
longer in St Patrick&#8217;s track, but on King William&#8217;s route
to the battle of the Boyne&mdash;and arrives in Drogheda to dinner.
He tells us that the country is very bare of wood, and then
proceeds in the following words to describe the habitations.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what shall I say of the <i>human habitations</i> in this (so
called) most thriving and best-conditioned quarter of Ireland?
If I had not seen every second face at a hovel-door with a
smile on it, and heard laughing and begging in the same breath
everywhere, I should think here were human beings abandoned
by their Maker. Many of the dwellings I saw upon the roadside
looked to me like the abodes of extinguished hope&mdash;forgotten
instincts&mdash;grovelling, despairing, nay, almost idiotic
wretchedness. I did not know there were such sights in the
world. I did not know that men and women, upright, and
made in God&#8217;s image, could live in styes, like swine, <i>with</i> swine&mdash;sitting,
lying down, cooking and eating in such filth as all
brute animals, save the one &#8216;unclean,&#8217; revolt from and avoid.
The extraordinary part of it, too, is, that it seems almost
altogether the result of choice. I scarce saw one hovel, the
mud-floor of which was not excavated several inches <i>below</i>
the ground-level without; and as there is no sill, or raised
threshold, there is no bar, I will not say to the water, but to
the liquid filth that oozes to its lower reservoir within. A few
miles from Drogheda, I pointed out to my companions a woman
sitting in a hovel at work, with the muddy water up to her
ancles, and an enormous hog scratching himself against her
knee. These disgusting animals were everywhere walking in
and out of the hovels at pleasure, jostling aside the half-naked
children, or wallowing in the wash, outside or in&mdash;the best-conditioned
and most privileged inmates, indeed, of every
habitation. All this, of course, is matter of choice, and so
is the offal-heap, situated, in almost every instance, directly
before the door, and draining its putrid mass into the hollow,
under the peasant&#8217;s table. Yet mirth <i>does</i> live in these places&mdash;people
<i>do</i> smile on you from these squalid abodes of wretchedness&mdash;the
rose of health <i>does</i> show itself upon the cheeks of
children, whose cradle is a dung-heap, and whose play-fellows
are hogs! And of the beings who live thus, courage, wit, and
quenchless love of liberty, are the undenied and universal
characteristics. Truly, that mysterious law of nature by which
corruption paints the rose and feeds the fragrant cup of the
lily, is not without its similitude! Who shall say what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
clean, when the back of the most loathsome of reptiles turns
out, on examination, more beautiful than the butterfly? Who
shall say what extremes may not meet, when, amid the filth of
an Irish hovel, spring, like flowers, out of ordure, the graces
of a prince in his palace?&#8221;</p>

<p>All this, the reader will remark, was seen from the top of
a stage-coach on a drenching wet day! What wonderful
powers of observation he must have! The penciller next
treats us to a song, descriptive of an Irish cabin, which he tells
us was sung for him by one of the most beautiful women he
saw in Ireland. His memorable arrival in Drogheda is thus
described:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;As we drove into Drogheda, we entered a crowd, which
I can only describe as suggesting the idea of a miraculous
advent of rags. It was market-day, and the streets were so
thronged that you could scarce see the pavement, except under
the feet of the horses; and the public square was a sea of tatters.
Here and all over Ireland I could but wonder where and
how these rent and frittered habiliments had gone through the
preparatory stages of wear and tear. There were no degrees&mdash;nothing
above rags to be seen in coat or petticoat, waistcoat
or breeches, cloak or shirt. Even the hats and shoes were in
rags; not a whole covering, even of the coarsest material, was
to be detected on a thousand backs about us: nothing shabby,
nothing threadbare, nothing mended, except here and there a
hole in a beggar&#8217;s coat, stuffed with straw. Who can give
me the genealogy of Irish rags? Who took the gloss from
these coats, once broadcloth? who wore them? who tore
them? who sold them to the Jews? (for, by the way, Irish rags
are fine rags, seldom frieze or fustian). How came the tatters
of the entire world, in short, assembled in Ireland? for
if, as it would seem, they have all descended from the backs
of gentlemen, the entire world must contribute to maintain the
supply.&#8221;</p>

<p>Readers, such of you as have been in Drogheda, did you
ever see any thing like this? People of Drogheda, do you
recognise yourselves in this picture here drawn of you? We
are sure you cannot. But he is not done with you yet. He
had been rather unlucky in the pursuit of his favourite subjects
for study in Belfast&mdash;namely, the beggars; but this disappointment
was atoned for in Drogheda. He describes them
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had been rather surprised at the scarcity of beggars in
Belfast, but the beggary of Drogheda fully came up to the
travellers&#8217; descriptions. They were of every possible variety.
At the first turn the coach made in the town, we were very
near running over a blind man, who knelt in the liquid mud of
the gutter (the calves of his legs quite covered by the pool,
and only his heels appearing above), and held up in his hands
the naked and footless stumps of a boy&#8217;s legs. The child
sat in a wooden box, with his back against the man&#8217;s breast,
and ate away very unconcernedly at a loaf of bread, while the
blind exhibitor turned his face up to the sky, and, waving the
stumps slightly from side to side, kept up a vociferation for
charity that was heard above all the turmoil of the market
place. When we stopped to change horses, the entire population,
as deep as they could stand, at least with any chance
of being heard, held out their hands, and in every conceivable
tone and mode of arresting the attention, implored charity.
The sight was awful: old age in shapes so hideous, I should
think the most horrible nightmare never had conceived. The
rain poured down upon their tangled and uncovered heads,
seaming, with its cleansing torrents, faces so hollow, so degraded
in expression, and, withal, so clotted with filth and
neglect, that they seemed like features of which the very owners
had long lost, not only care, but consciousness and remembrance;
as if, in the horrors of want and idiotcy, they had
anticipated the corrupting apathy of the grave, and abandoned
every thing except the hunger which gnawed them into
memory of existence. The feeble blows and palsied fighting
of these hag-like spectres for the pence thrown to them from
the coach, and the howling, harsh, and unnatural voices in
which they imprecated curses on each other in the fury of the
struggle, have left a remembrance in my mind, which deepens
immeasurably my fancied <i>nadir</i> of human abandonment and
degradation. God&#8217;s image so blasted, so defiled, so sunk below
the beasts that perish, I would not have believed was to
be found in the same world with <i>hope</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>But we, and our readers too, have probably had enough of
Mr Willis&#8217;s &#8220;Pencillings by the Way&#8221; in Ireland&mdash;pencillings
which would seem to have been sketched with a material to
which he is apparently very partial, namely, dirt. And now,
in return for the favour which this gentleman and his coadjutor
have conferred upon us, by their exertions to enable us
to improve our acquaintance with ourselves, we shall communicate
our own opinion of them, and hope they will be equally
benefited by the knowledge. We think, then, that they are
a pair of gentlemen who must have a wonderfully good opinion
of themselves, and that not altogether without reason,
inasmuch as they possess in common one quality, which shall
be nameless, but in which not even we, natives of the Emerald
Isle as we are, can pretend to compete with them. We do
not think that there are any two Irishmen living, who would
travel into a foreign country to represent its scenery like the
one, or sketch the manners and characteristics of its inhabitants
like the other, and expect that they should be rewarded
by the purchase of their works by that people or in that
country. Mr Bartlett is but an indifferent artist, unacquainted
even with some of the rudiments of his art, who
has acquired the trade-knack of making pretty pictures by
imitating the works of others, and by a total disregard of the
real features of the scenes which he undertakes to depict.
Mr Willis is a more accomplished sketcher in his line; and
his delineations might be of value, if his conceited ambition to
produce effect did not continually mar whatever intrinsic
worth they might otherwise possess; but as it is, he is little
better than a pert and flippant caricaturist. Neither one nor
the other of these gentlemen, in short, would seem qualified
for the task which they have so daringly undertaken; and we
think it would have been well, if, before they resolved upon
going through with it, they had been mindful of the Eastern
proverb, &#8220;A lie, though it promise good, will do thee harm,
and truth will do thee good at the last.&#8221; Applying this to
ourselves as critics, we feel in conclusion bound to acknowledge
that the prints in this work, considered as engravings,
are deserving of the highest praise.</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;THERE&#8217;S LUCK IN LEISURE.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;DELAYS ARE DANGEROUS.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;James Scanlan wants to see you, sir. I told him you
were hardly done dinner, but he begged me to let you know
he is waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me,&#8221; said my father, &#8220;what can he want? Show
him in, Carey.&mdash;Well, James, what is the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! your honour, sir, won&#8217;t you come see my poor father?
He&#8217;ll speak to you, but we can&#8217;t get a word from him. He&#8217;s
dying of grief, my mother is so bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mother, James!&mdash;what has happened her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She took a heavy cold, sir, on Friday last, from a wetting
she got going to Cashel; and when she came home, she took
to her bed, and it&#8217;s worse and worse she has got ever since,
and at last she began to rave this morning; and as Dr
M&#8217;Carthy was going past to the dispensary, Pat called him
in; and when he looked at her, he just shook his head and said
he&#8217;d send her something, but that we must be prepared for
any thing that might happen. Well, sir, when my father
heard that, he went and sat down by the bedside, and taking
my mother&#8217;s hand in his, says he, &#8216;Ah, then, Mary, a-cushla-machree,
am I going to lose you? Are you going from me?
Did I ever think I&#8217;d see this day? Ah, Mary, avourneen,
sure you won&#8217;t leave me?&#8217; And from that to this he has
never stirred, nor spoken, nor taken the least notice of any
one&mdash;not even of me&mdash;not even of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor fellow burst into a flood of tears.</p>

<p>In a few minutes I was standing with my father by the bedside
of Mrs Scanlan. She was quite unconscious of what was
passing around. Her husband, who was my father&#8217;s principal
tenant, and a substantial farmer, sat as his eldest and
favourite son had described; and although the object of my
father&#8217;s visit was to rouse him from his lethargy, it was long
ere he addressed himself to the task. It seemed almost
sacrilegious to disturb such hallowed grief.</p>

<p>At length he laid his hand upon Scanlan&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;Come,
James,&#8221; said he, &#8220;look up, man; don&#8217;t be so utterly cast down.
You know the old saying, &#8216;Whilst there&#8217;s life, there&#8217;s hope.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of your honour to try and comfort me; but
yours was always the good heart, and the kind one, and you
never made the sight of your sunny face a compliment. But
it&#8217;s no use&mdash;there&#8217;s no hope. The death&#8217;s on her handsome
countenance.&#8221;</p>

<p>He groaned deeply, and rocked himself backwards and forwards.</p>

<p>&#8220;James,&#8221; said my father, &#8220;we must be resigned to the will
of God, but we need not make ourselves miserable by anticipating
evils.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your honour was but a slip of a gossoon when you danced
at the bright girl&#8217;s wedding, and you&#8217;re come now in time to
see the last of the old woman&mdash;the old woman, the old
woman,&#8221; repeated he, as if something struck him in the sound
of the words as strange. &#8220;Two-and-forty is not old, but they
called her &#8216;the old woman&#8217; since the boys began to grow up.
But she never grew old to me; she&#8217;s the same now that she
was the first evening I told her, that she was the only treasure
on the face of the earth that my heart coveted. Only, much
as I loved her then, I love her more now. Oh! Mary, Mary,
pulse of my heart, would to God I could die before you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The younger son Pat, his mother&#8217;s favourite, now entered
the room in a state of pitiable excitement. He had been at
the dispensary to procure the medicine prescribed by the
doctor, and to his imagination every person and every thing
seemed to have conspired to delay him, whilst the lookers on
deemed his haste almost superhuman.</p>

<p>He immediately attempted to administer the draught he had
brought, but his mother could not be made to understand what
was wanted of her; and at length, as if teased by his importunities,
she suddenly dashed the cup of medicine from her.</p>

<p>The look of unutterable anguish with which he regarded
her, as she rejected and destroyed that upon the taking of
which depended the last hope, was indescribable.</p>

<p>The almost fierceness of his haste, which he now saw had
been utterly useless, had flushed his cheek and lighted up his
countenance, and he stood with his hands clasped, and raised
as if in prayer, with firmly shut lips, and his eyes, in which
you could view the transition from eager hope to utter despair,
fixed upon her face, like a being that was changing into stone.</p>

<p>At the other side of the bed was his father, who had resumed
his former attitude, and beside him stood his eldest son,
whose utterly wretched countenance, alternating from one
parent to the other, showed that he suffered that lowest state
of misery, which anticipates still further and greater woe as a
consequence from that which overwhelms at present.</p>

<p>My father left the room. I looked upon the group one instant.
I felt that I could have resigned the possession of worlds
to be permitted the luxury of raising the load of grief from
those afflicted hearts; but it could not be, and I retired to
relieve my surcharged feelings in solitude.</p>

<p>Ere morning dawned, nature had received another instalment
of her debt.</p>

<p>My father and I attended the funeral, and were surprised
at the apparent fortitude of Mr Scanlan. We wished to bring
him with us to the Hall after the sad ceremony, but he would
not come. We then accompanied him to his own house. As
we entered, I glanced at him: he was ghastly pale. He looked
slowly round, fixed his eyes one moment on the countenance
of his younger son, another on the elder, and sank upon a
chair.</p>

<p>Since the period of which I now write, I have often witnessed
the closing scene of mortality, and various are the opinions
I have heard, as to which point of time, between the
moment of death and the first appearance abroad of the survivors
in their mourning apparel, is the saddest, the most
afflicting, or the most trying&mdash;whether the moment of dissolution,
the first appearance of the undertaker, the laying
out in the apparel of death, the bringing of the coffin, the last
frantic kiss and look, the screwing down, the carrying out,
the dull thud of the clay upon the coffin lid. Oh! think not
that I am coolly writing this, that I am probing with the surgeon&#8217;s
calmness the deep, the sensitive (with many bleeding)
wounds that death has given.</p>

<p>I am but a young man, yet my brain reels, and my eyes
burn, and my heart swells to my throat, as memory holds the
mirror to my view, and I see depicted in it the scenes, and
feel again the feelings, that have been more than once or twice
excited at the stages which I have just recounted in order.
But of all the stabs thus given to the heart, of all those moments
of anguish, the keenest is that felt when the survivor
re-enters the house, where the form and the voice and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
cheerful laugh of the departed one had made his home a little
paradise, and feels that that home is now for ever desolate!
Is there a desert so deserted?</p>

<p>&#8220;James,&#8221; said Mr Scanlan, after he had looked steadfastly
at him for some time, &#8220;you were the first she brought me; and
when you came into the world, I was almost beside myself with
joy; and when I was allowed to enter the room where she was
sitting up in bed, with you in her arms, I almost smothered
you both with kisses; and I cried, and laughed, and danced
about, as if I was mad. Sure I need&#8217;nt be ashamed to own
it, now that she&#8217;s gone. And when I told her that they said
you were the image of me, she answered me, &#8216;So he ought,
for sure you were always before my eyes;&#8217; and when I said
that I could&#8217;nt be &#8216;always,&#8217; she said that &#8217;twas the eyes of her
heart she meant. So, Pat, avourneen (addressing the younger,
who had been all this time crying bitterly), though you&#8217;re the
living image of her that&#8217;s dead, and though father could&#8217;nt
love son more than I do you, you&#8217;re not surprised that I
gave James the preference sometimes, though I never loved
you the less.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father dear,&#8221; said Pat, &#8220;I was never jealous of Jem,
nor he of me; we both knew that our faces and tempers and
dispositions took after you both&mdash;Jem&#8217;s after you, and mine
after my mother. Oh! mother dear! mother dear!&#8221; He burst
into a paroxysm of grief, ran wildly into his mother&#8217;s room,
and threw himself across the bed, roaring in a frenzied manner,
&#8220;James, honey, isn&#8217;t the house terrible lonesome?&#8221; and a
violent shudder ran through poor Scanlan&#8217;s frame. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t
there a great echo in it? It&#8217;s very chilly; I believe I had
better go and lie down on the bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood up, and, continuing the forward movement of his
body after he had risen to a standing position, would have
fallen, extended on his face, but that I caught him just as his
watchful son had sprung to save him.</p>

<p>Poor Pat now mastered his feelings in some degree, and
turned his entire attention to assist his surviving parent.
He was laid on the bed, and shortly recovered himself, and
addressed my father. &#8220;I know your honour feels for my
trouble, and will excuse the boys and me for not showing
the attention we ought to show for your goodness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say nothing about attention to me, James; I am sorry for
your trouble, and, God knows, I wish I knew how to relieve
and comfort you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you do, sir.&mdash;Boys, I won&#8217;t be long with you.
The pulse of my heart is gone. Look up to his honour, and
never forget, that, though there&#8217;s no clanship in these times,
and though many a shoneen holds a higher head than his in the
country now, you still owe him your love and fealty, for he&#8217;s
one of the real old stock; and your forefathers followed his
forefathers in war and peace, when, if you stood on the highest
crag of the Bogaragh, you could&#8217;nt see to the bounds of their
wide domains. And while his honour is present, and I have
my senses clear about me, I&#8217;ll lay my commands on you both,
boys; and if ever you break through them (though I am sure
you never will), let his honour, and the young master here bear
witness against you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He then delivered what was simply a verbal will, directing
how they should dispose of and divide his property and effects,
and concluded as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;When your mother and I were married, we were both of
us full of old sayings and proverbs, and we thought, like most
others, that their meaning should be taken in the plainest and
fullest signification; and as most of them are universally
allowed to contain a great deal of wisdom and good sense, we
thought that whoever regulated his or her conduct strictly
according to their rule, would of necessity be the wisest person
in the world.</p>

<p>One of these sayings, that I had been taught to believe was
one of the wisest ever pronounced by man, was, &#8216;there&#8217;s luck
in leisure,&#8217; and this was my most favourite maxim; but when
I got married, I found that your mother&mdash;that your mother
had a favourite one also&mdash;&#8216;delays are dangerous.&#8217;</p>

<p>Well, the first year, when the corn was coming up, a corn
factor came to this part of the country, and offered a middling
fair price for an average crop. Mary bade me take it, as I&#8217;d
have that much money certain, and if the season should turn
out bad, the factor would be the sufferer, and I&#8217;d be safe.</p>

<p>&#8216;Take it at once,&#8217; said she; &#8216;you know &#8220;delays are dangerous.&#8221;&#8217;</p>

<p>I began to consider that if the season should be only middling,
inclining to bad, I might get as much money still, as
the factor offered; and if it should turn out fine, the crop
would produce a great deal more, whilst it would be only in
the event of a bad season that I&#8217;d be apt to lose. &#8216;There&#8217;s
luck in leisure,&#8217; said I; &#8216;I&#8217;ll wait.&#8217;</p>

<p>Well, the season was dreadful: most of the crops were totally
destroyed, and we suffered more than almost any of the
neighbours. I was afraid to look Mary in the face, when I
had made out the extent of my loss, but she only said, &#8216;Come,
Jemmy, it can&#8217;t be helped; the worse luck now, the better
another time. You&#8217;ll attend more to wise old sayings for the
future; they were made out of wiser heads than yours.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah, but, Mary, a-cushla, it was following an old saying that
I was; sure you have often heard say, &#8220;there&#8217;s luck in leisure.&#8221;&#8217;
&#8216;Poh,&#8217; said she, &#8216;that&#8217;s only a foolish saying, take
my word for it.&#8217;</p>

<p>Next year the sky-farmer came again. He had lost nothing,
for no one would deal with him, on his terms, the year
before; and to hear how heartlessly he&#8217;d jeer and jibe them
that had the sore hearts in their bosoms, and calculate up for
them how much they had lost, and then he&#8217;d say, he supposed
they would&#8217;nt refuse a good offer another time. Well, I asked
him was he going to make me a good offer, and he said he
would&#8217;nt care if he did, and he offered as much as would
hardly pay the rent, letting alone seed and labour. &#8216;Why,&#8217;
said I, &#8216;you&#8217;ll give as much as you offered last year.&#8217; &#8216;Not I
indeed,&#8217; said he; &#8216;I bought experience instead of corn last year,
and you paid for it;&#8217; and he laughed, and shook himself with
glee, and chuckled, and jingled the guineas in his pockets,
until I was hardly able to keep from knocking him down.</p>

<p>Well, I higgled and bargained, and tried to raise him, but
not another penny would he give; and at last he said that
he was going away in the morning, and so I might take it or
leave it, as I liked&mdash;he would&#8217;nt force his money on any man,
not he. &#8216;Delays are dangerous,&#8217; thought I; and, though it
was a certain loss, I agreed.</p>

<p>A finer season than that, never came from the heavens.
The factor came to see the crops, and such crops as they were!
Several others had done like me; and if he laughed at us the
year before, he laughed ten times more now. The year before
he had lost nothing: this year he had made a fortune. He
had laughed at our losses before, but he now laughed over his
own gains. &#8216;They may laugh who win.&#8217;</p>

<p>If he had taken it quieter, he might have done the same
thing again; but by acting as he did, he set every one against
him, and he never after could buy up growing crops here.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mary, my darling,&#8217; said I, &#8216;we&#8217;re almost ruined, in the
second year, by following old sayings. I&#8217;ll never believe in
them again.&#8217; &#8216;Jemmy, dear,&#8217; said she, &#8216;I have been thinking
the matter over, and I believe it&#8217;s not the sayings that are
wrong, but the wrong use that&#8217;s made of them; for if we had
said them the other way, we&#8217;d have made money instead of
losing it; and for the future we&#8217;ll try to use the sense that
God has given us, and the acquirements such as they are that
He has enabled us to obtain, in directing us to the proper use
and timely application of those proverbs that are really wise
and useful when properly applied.&#8217;</p>

<p>As it was the will of the Almighty, boys, that your dear
mother should not have had her senses about her when departing,
and it&#8217;s likely that these are the last of her sensible words
that I&#8217;ll ever be able to tell you, I&#8217;d have you take them, and
think upon them as if they were her last addressed to you,
and let neither proverbs, however apparently wise in themselves,
nor superstitious remarks, ever guide your actions or
sway your conduct until you have applied to them the touchstone
of your own common sense.</p>

<p>May God bless and guide you, my darling boys; and now
I have done with the world and its affairs.&#8221;</p>

NERVOUS COMPLAINTS.</h2>

<p>In a London medical work entitled <i>The Doctor</i>, are given the
particulars of an interesting case of neuralgia, or <i>tic douleureux</i>,
which, it appears, after having been treated with the usual
medicines for more than two years, with little or no remission
of the painful symptoms attending it, yielded at length
to a new and extraordinary remedy, in the shape of a <i>metal
magnet</i>. The experiments tried upon the occasion promise
results of such considerable interest and practical importance
to the health perhaps of thousands, that we shall offer no
apology to our readers for copying the history of the cure
and the accompanying details into our columns, premising
only, that while we individually place every reliance on the
good faith of the witnesses who attest the facts recorded,
we do not consider ourselves bound to vouch for their statement
authoritatively to others, or draw any inference of a
positive kind with respect to a remedy, of the nature and
effects of which, after all, it is properly the province of the
faculty alone to form a judgment.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our readers (observes the writer) will remember the interesting
case of neuralgia of the finger, at St Thomas&#8217;s Hospital,
upon which Dr Elliotson stated, in a clinical lecture,
that he had exhausted his store of remedial agents, without
developing a shade of improvement. [The remedies resorted to
primarily were, carbonate of iron, cyanuret of potass, strychnine,
croton oil, hydrocyanic acid, and extract of belladonna.]
A more severe case, probably, was never subjected to
treatment. The man left the hospital for a time, totally unrelieved,
but soon afterwards returned, when, in accordance
with a suggestion, as Dr Elliotson has since observed, of a
correspondent of our own, the <i>colchicum autumnale</i> was tried
in the case, without, however, the slightest benefit being derived
therefrom. The sedative powers of the <i>lobelia inflata</i>
then suggested to Dr Elliotson the propriety of giving the
patient the chance of that medicine. The grounds on which
it was employed proved to be in some measure correctly
founded. The man took the <i>lobelia</i>, in increasing doses, every
hour, beginning with seven drops of the tincture, and adding
a drop to each progressive dose, until as large a quantity had
been reached as could be taken without deranging the functions
of the stomach. Some amelioration of the affection followed
this treatment. The patient, who was before unable
even to cross the ward, or bear without excruciating agony
the slightest contact with his finger-nails, and had become
emaciated to the extremest degree, from pain and sleeplessness,
was now enabled to walk a little way and enjoy intervals
of rest, partly recovered his good looks, and became
comparatively cheerful.</p>

<p>The relief, however, was very far from being either perfect
or permanent. In fact, the continued exhibition of the medicine
was demanded to secure any portion of rest.</p>

<p>A short time since, however, a new remedial agent presented
itself, in the form of the <i>magnet</i>. The hospital was
visited, first by Dr Kyle, and subsequently by Dr Blundell,
who followed up the application begun by Dr Kyle. The
<i>lobelia inflata</i> was allowed by Dr Elliotson to be suspended,
and the effect of the magnet tried. That effect was, to the
surprise of all who witnessed it, a most decided one; the
pain was, on every application of the instrument, removed,
and continued absent for several hours.</p>

<p>On Tuesday last [in June 1833], Dr Blundell attended the
hospital at the hour of Dr Elliotson&#8217;s visit, when, in the presence
of the pupils and our reporter, he drew forth the magnet,
and commenced its application to the patient&#8217;s finger.</p>

<p>The instrument is of the horse-shoe form, about ten inches
in its long axis, and five in its short, composed of five layers
of metal, the central being the longest, and the whole bound
with stout ribbon. The patient was at the time apparently
suffering considerable pain, <i>and unable to use his hand</i>. The
<i>north</i> pole of the magnet was gently passed five or six times
down the sides and back of the middle finger, and then rested
on the central joint. The result was such an immediate cessation
of suffering, that he could gnash his fingers into the
palm of his hand with ease and comfort, and he declared himself
to be entirely relieved. The power of the instrument,
however, did not cease here. Dr Blundell showed that it
possessed the means of reproducing the pain in the most intense
form. The <i>south</i> pole of the magnet was directed along
the finger. At the third pass the patient began to bite his
lip and close his eyes with an expression of pain. At a few
passes more his chin was spasmodically buried in his breast,
and his wrinkled features expressed the acutest suffering.
This was allowed to continue for a few seconds, when the
<i>north</i> pole was again presented to the finger, and the agony
speedily subsided. The spectators then left the man lying
with a countenance perfectly tranquil.</p>

<p>At the extremity of the ward lay an elderly lady, a
martyr to <i>tic douleureux</i> in the lower jaw, extending to the
ear, and affecting a large portion of the head. The disease,
she stated, was of more than nine years&#8217; duration, and had
never ceased to afflict her for a day during that period, up to
her entrance into the hospital. Her appearance was proportionably
miserable. The magnet had also been applied in
her case, and with similar advantage, as she stated. On the
present occasion it was found, on approaching her bed, that
she was in consequence free from pain on that morning, and
the further aid of the magnet was not needed. &#8216;But cannot
you show its power by producing the pain?&#8217; inquired a bystander.
The suggestion was acted on. The <i>south</i> pole of
the magnet was passed from the centre of the chin along the
lower jawbone up to the ear. At the third pass the poor
woman indicated that the <i>tic</i> was commencing, and in a few
seconds more the affection was experienced intensely. The
process was then stopped, as the experiment had been carried
far enough to satisfy all present of its consummation; and
after a brief space the presentation of the <i>north</i> pole wholly
freed the sufferer from pain. The operator subsequently
stated, that by continuing the passes he could have carried
the pain on to the production of delirium.</p>

<p>There is a female patient in another ward, who had suffered
intense toothache for three months, when, a fortnight
since, according to her own evidence, which we have no reason
to doubt, it was instantly cured by <i>one application</i> of the
magnet, through the medium of a key, and had not returned
in the slightest degree up to the period of the visit of which
we have given the details.</p>

<p>These are very interesting facts. We submit them to
our readers unaccompanied by comment. The specific name
given to his instrument by Dr Blundell, is that of &#8216;mineral
magnet.&#8217; How far its application to disease admits of extension,
we are at present ignorant.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
